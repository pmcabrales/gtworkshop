# Testing an IGApp for beginners workshop

### Goal

The main goal of this workshop is to learn the basics of GT:API framework and how to test an IGApp from the scratch. At the end of this workshop you'll know the following:

* The GT:API Architecture

* Write integration tests for an IG App

### Requirements

Good knowledge of Java.

It's mandatory to have installed the next tools before the workshop beginning (Don't hesitate to contact the organizers if you have any problem):

* Java 11 SDK https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html
* GIT
* Preferred IDE. We will use IntelliJ Community.
* Go to IntelliJâ€™s marketplace and install these plugins:
  * Cucumber for Java 
  * Scala
  * Gherkin

### What are we going to do?

First of all we are creating a new GT Framework project from a template, and we will go through the most important pieces of code and configuration.

After that it's time to code! We'll build step by step a very basic integration test using GT:API for an IG application running in our local environment.
