# Challenge 2

Now, let's create our functional test

## Step 1
Create an action scenario in the sparePart feature that will receive 4 arguments (brandCode, modelCode, modelYear and sparePartType) and will return the first spare part found

## Step 2
Create an action scenario in the Price feature that will receive 2 arguments (productId and date) and will return a price

## Step 3
Create the new feature class SparePartPrice.
We will check that the price of the OPEL Astra mirror has a 10% yearly increment in price.
To do that we will call the two actions created in the previous steps.
